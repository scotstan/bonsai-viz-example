# Bonsai Visualizer Examples

## Intro

The Bonsai App visualizer plugin API is intended to allow you to create
custom visualizations of your simulation state and action space. These
visualizations can be loaded into the Bonsai App when displaying episode
data, making it easier to understand.

The Bonsai App will send updated state that follows the user’s cursor
when they hover over chart data.

## Overview

Plugins are URLs to a JavaScript web application hosted somewhere that
the user’s browser can access. These URLs are loaded into an IFrame by
the Bonsai App. You will need to provide your own hosting for your
plugins.

You can use pure JavaScript, or a web framework like React or Angular.
We use the Window.postMessage() API to communicate with the plugin in
the IFrame.

The plugin will also be passed a variety of query parameters when it is
loaded. Some of them are reserved by the plugin API, but a developer can
have the user pass in additional configuration parameters as necessary.

## Connecting Inkling to the Visualizer

Enable the visualizer in Inkling with the following line:

```
const SimulatorVisualizer = "https://microsoft.github.io/bonsai-viz-example/cartpole"
```

Use one of `cartpole`, `simpletank`, `plasticsextruder` in the path
above.

We have the following examples in this repo:

## Cart + Pole

![Cart + Pole](cartpole/ExampleViz.png "A cart+pole system.")

## Simple Tank

![Simple Tank](simpletank/ExampleViz.png "A basic tank filling controller.")

## Plastics Extruder

![Plastics Extruder](plasticsextruder/ExampleViz.png "An industrial extruder.")
